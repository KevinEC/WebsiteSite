				<h2>Biography</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				Bo Henrik lives for the mix. He’s got old-school artistry in his genes, wild <sp>nature in his sights, and North America and Sweden as his life’s cultural forces. These days he lives in Vancouver, Canada, where he’s inspired by the beautiful city and its beat, backed up by forest and mountains.
				<br>
				His sound is a result of cross-generational collaboration, writingalongside a 60-year old Canadian and sometimes his older brother. Many of his fondest experiences and story sources come from couch surfing at the homes of fellow musicians and producers.  Curious to a fault, Bo Henrik plays and arranges all the instruments in his songs, and is grateful to those who put the finishing touches on his work

						<h3>REPLAY</h3>
						<p>
							Lots of retro references in this song.  Spent a session with Dave Stanley Doust and Bryan Fogelman at a rafting resort and the fresh air gave us that melody. Once the idea of the mix tape caught on, we wrote the verses that are actually titles from hit songs - both recent and distant past - and we kept chasing re-writing and second-chance ideas. It feels cool to sing this one.

						<h3>I FELL</h3>
						<p>
							This song came to me in a burst of endorphins after 30 minutes of running near Lake Vancouver, where I’ve been living with my singing coach and mentor.  I started thinking about all the cool girls I’ve met in Vancouver, their style and their taste in music.  I came up with the first line, “Cool vintage ride but she never got a license…” on the way uphill, and downhill the rest just came to me.

						<h3>BACK OF MY HEAD</h3>
						<p>
							You know those relationships that are a little bit dangerous but too much fun?  Eventually you have to leave them and put them behind you - and you’re not supposed to admit how much you enjoyed that time.  We went for an old piano sound over trap drums to tap into that trashy feeling. My brother and I wrote these lyrics and then recorded a demo at 3am, after a terrible session of Jägermeister and cheese fries that gave my voice a really dirty sound.

						<h3>TAKE ME TO THE SUNLIGHT</h3>
						<p>
							I’m usually an upbeat person and this song came out of a strange, dark time in life. I had just left everything safe and secure in Sweden, arrived at a rafting resort in British Columbia where I was supposedly starting my music career.  A recording studio was nowhere to be seen and I wondered what the hell I was doing.  The bluesy chromatic melody came to me and I put it aside, figuring I’d never use it.  Later, I started working on different verses and choruses. Eighteen versions later, we found what works, probably because I moved closer to a recording studio.

						<h3>YOUNG SOULS</h3>
						<p>
							In Young Souls, I wanted to encapsulate tons of good vibes into a song.  One night in Vancouver, I partied with cool travelers from Australia, England, France, Germany, Ireland, and Italy. We made an illegal fire on the beach while watching the sunset behind the mountains, city skyline, and the water. Only in Vancouver, right? I learned to hula hoop with neon-glowing hula hoops, we were freestyling and playing music and laughing at everything.  I wanted that awesome feeling to last forever, so it became this song.
