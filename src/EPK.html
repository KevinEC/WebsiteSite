				<h2>Biography</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				Bo Henrik lives for the mix. He’s got old-school artistry in his genes, wild <sp>nature in his sights, and North America and Sweden as his life’s cultural forces. These days he lives in Vancouver, Canada, where he’s inspired by the beautiful city and its beat, backed up by forest and mountains.
				<br>
				His sound is a result of cross-generational collaboration, writingalongside a 60-year old Canadian and sometimes his older brother. Many of his fondest experiences and story sources come from couch surfing at the homes of fellow musicians and producers.  Curious to a fault, Bo Henrik plays and arranges all the instruments in his songs, and is grateful to those who put the finishing touches on his work

					<h3>Take me to the Sunlight</h3>
					<p>
						I’m usually an upbeat person and this song came out of a strange, dark time in life. I had just left everything safe and secure in Sweden, arrived at a rafting resort in British Columbia where I was supposedly starting my music career. A recording studio was nowhere to be seen and I wondered what the hell I was doing.  The bluesy chromatic melody came to me and I put it aside, figuring I’d never use it. Later, I started working on different verses and choruses. Eighteen versions later, we found what works, probably because I moved closer to a recording studio
